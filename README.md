# hdfs-rs
The goal of this project is to refactor HDFS by using Rust-Lang. All programmers know that HDFS is mainly developed by JAVA, the obvious difference between Rust and Java is that the latter runs on the JVM, so it’s just-in-time compiled. In extreme cases, full GC occurs in the JVM. Rust does not have GC problem. Rust is a programming language with a focus on type safety, memory safety, concurrentcy and performance. Rust is intended for writing large-scale, high-performance software that is free from several classes of common errors.Rust has a sophisticated memory model that encourages efficient data structures and safe concurrency patterns, forbidding invalid memory access that would otherwise cause segmentation faults. It is statically typed and compiled ahead of time. I believe we can refactor HDFS by Rust and make it more stable, reliable and high-performance with worrying about GC problems in extreme conditions.
